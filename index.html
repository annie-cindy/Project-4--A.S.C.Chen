      <h5 class="w3-center">Tradition since 1892</h5>
      <p class="w3-large">Coca-Cola, or Coke, is a carbonated soft drink manufactured by The Coca-Cola Company. Originally marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, it was invented in the late 19th century by John Stith Pemberton and was bought out by businessman Asa Griggs Candler, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the world soft-drink market throughout the 20th century. The drink's name refers to two of its original ingredients: coca leaves, and kola nuts (a source of caffeine). The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret, although a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published.</p>

        

      <p class="w3-large w3-text-grey w3-hide-medium"><p>
        The Coca-Cola Company produces concentrate, which is then sold to licensed Coca-Cola bottlers throughout the world. The bottlers, who hold exclusive territory contracts with the company, produce the finished product in cans and bottles from the concentrate, in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. A typical 12-US-fluid-ounce (350 ml) can contains 38 grams (1.3 oz) of sugar (usually in the form of high fructose corn syrup). The bottlers then sell, distribute, and merchandise Coca-Cola to retail stores, restaurants, and vending machines throughout the world</p> The Coca-Cola Company also sells concentrate for soda fountains of major restaurants and foodservice distributors.</div>

      <h5 class="w3-center" class="w3-large">History of Coca Cola</h5>
    <p style="padding-right: 100px; padding-left: 100px;">Coca-Cola history began in 1886 when the curiosity of an Atlanta pharmacist, Dr. John S. Pemberton, led him to create a distinctive tasting soft drink that could be sold at soda fountains. He created a flavored syrup, took it to his neighborhood pharmacy, where it was mixed with carbonated water and deemed “excellent” by those who sampled it. Dr. Pemberton’s partner and bookkeeper, Frank M. Robinson, is credited with naming the beverage “Coca‑Cola” as well as designing the trademarked, distinct script, still used today.
      Prior to his death in 1888, just two years after creating what was to become the world’s #1-selling sparkling beverage, Dr. Pemberton sold portions of his business to various parties, with the majority of the interest sold to Atlanta businessman, Asa G. Candler. Under Mr. Candler’s leadership, distribution of Coca‑Cola expanded to soda fountains beyond Atlanta. In 1894, impressed by the growing demand for Coca‑Cola and the desire to make the beverage portable, Joseph Biedenharn installed bottling machinery in the rear of his Mississippi soda fountain, becoming the first to put Coca‑Cola in bottles. Large scale bottling was made possible just five years later, when in 1899, three enterprising businessmen in Chattanooga, Tennessee secured exclusive rights to bottle and sell Coca‑Cola. The three entrepreneurs purchased the bottling rights from Asa Candler for just $1. Benjamin Thomas, Joseph Whitehead and John Lupton developed what became the Coca‑Cola worldwide bottling system.</p>

      <h5 class="w3-center">EVOLUTION OF THE COCA-COLA BOTTLE</h5>
<p style="padding-right: 100px; padding-left: 100px;">The 1980s featured such memorable slogans as “Coke is It!”, “Catch the Wave” and “Can’t Beat the Feeling”. In 1993, Coca‑Cola experimented with computer animation, and the popular “Always Coca‑Cola” campaign was launched in a series of ads featuring animated polar bears. Each animated ad in the “Always Coca‑Cola” series took 12 weeks to produce from beginning to end. The bears were, and still are, a huge hit with consumers because of their embodiment of characteristics like innocence, mischief and fun. A favorite feature at World of Coca‑Cola is the ability to have your photo taken with the beloved 7′ tall Coca‑Cola Polar Bear.</p>

    <p style="padding-right: 100px; padding-left: 100px;">World of Coca-Cola has achieved official “green” status as an environmentally friendly building, and was awarded a “Gold” rating by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC).

        World of Coca-Cola adheres to the USGBC’s standards for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), which encourages development of “high-performance, sustainable buildings” through an emphasis on energy and water efficiency, recycling, reuse of resources and waste reduction. It is one of a growing group of buildings in the state of Georgia to achieve LEED certification.</p>

<p style="padding-left: 100px; padding-right: 100px;">Approximately 20% of the building construction materials were recycled, including environmentally friendly bamboo and recycled rubber flooring.
The carpeting is “cradle to cradle” which means it is made from recycled carpet.
Almost 90% of construction waste from the project was salvaged, reused or recycled.
The landscaping features in and around World of Coca-Cola include light-colored paving, vegetated grounds, and a reflective roof to reduce the urban “heat island effect.”
Inside, the air quality has been enhanced through low-emission paints, adhesives, sealants and carpeting.
The entire building was designed to optimize energy efficiency and is 30% more energy efficient than standards required by the Georgia state energy code.
The attraction also uses 40% less water than standard buildings as every faucet and water fixture has been fitted for lowering water consumption.
    Beverage cups in the popular Taste It! beverage lounge are fully recyclable and are made with PlantBottle Technology™</p>
